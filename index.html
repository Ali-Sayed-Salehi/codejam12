                    <p>"Itâ€™s not often you get to build an automated, dynamic calendar while sipping a dangerous number of Guru Organic Energy Drinksâ„¢ and downing an (almost certainly) unhealthy amount of Osmowâ€™s shawarmaâ€“poutine over  a thirty-six hour period. But alas, such is the life of the Pure JS Lovers at CodeJam 12. To make a long story short: Itâ€™s been a wild and fun ride for our team so far at CodeJam. Weâ€™ve learned a lot, and we hope the rest of our competitors have had as much fun as we have. I think itâ€™s safe to say weâ€™ve sacrificed an offensive amount of code readability and organized software design for the sake of functionality (Prof. Martin Robillard would no doubt be extremely disappointed with us on this front)â€¦ Maybe you can relate. In any case, the grind has been lots of fun and sometimes this is just how the cookie crumbles when youâ€™re on a time-crunch. Weâ€™re excited to see everyone elseâ€™s projects and wish everyone the best of luck. And nice work on putting together this blog!"</p>

                    <h3>Group 2: KDF</h3>
                    <p>Heyo this is KDF! We are a rag-tag group of CompSci and engineering students from McGill and Polytech, and we are really excited to be here this weekend! 

                        This is our first time at Codejam, and we wanted to start with a bang by incorporating the latest technologies in our project: "tailor maid". "tailor maid" is an AI application that runs on any browser which uses AI to identify the color and type of clothing in a picture, and then it will classify into a database to then suggest appropriate outfits based on the weather. We hope that by making such an app, we can save many people from wasting time in the morning deciding what to wear. 
                        
                        Due to us using very cutting edge technologies such as EfficientNet for our machine learning model, it was a huge challenge of cooperation, time management and googling to get this project running. Even then, there are many features that we still haven't managed to implement...
                        
                        Anyhow, it was a very cool experience, and our experienced and inexperienced members both learned a lot from this hackathon. Cheers and best of luck to all!</p>
