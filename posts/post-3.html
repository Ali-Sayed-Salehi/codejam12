                    <h3>Title of the first post</h3>
                    <p>Heyo this is KDF! We are a rag-tag group of CompSci and 
                        engineering students from McGill and Polytech, and we 
                        are really excited to be here this weekend!
                    </p>
                    <p> This is our first time at Codejam, and we wanted to 
                        start with a bang by incorporating the latest 
                        technologies in our project: "tailor maid". 
                        "tailor maid" is an AI application that runs on any 
                        browser which uses AI to identify the color and type 
                        of clothing in a picture, and then it will classify 
                        into a database to then suggest appropriate outfits 
                        based on the weather. We hope that by making such an 
                        app, we can save many people from wasting time in the 
                        morning deciding what to wear. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to us using very cutting edge technologies such as 
                        EfficientNet for our machine learning model, it was a 
                        huge challenge of cooperation, time management and 
                        googling to get this project running. Even then, 
                        there are many features that we still haven't managed 
                        to implement...</p>
                        <p>
                            Anyhow, it was a very cool experience, and our 
                        experienced and inexperienced members both learned a 
                        lot from this hackathon. Cheers and best of luck to all!
                        </p>
