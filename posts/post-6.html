                    <h3>Stephan from Matrox</h3>
                    <p>It is always a pleasure to see a bunch of motivated a 
                        students working really hard on their own projects. As a 
                        Matrox representative, we have had the chance to see the 
                        great qualities of the students
                        during this weekend. </p>
                        
                        <p>Motivation, curiosity, teamworking 
                        and communication are just a few among
                        them. Also, as a past student in engineering, it reminds 
                        me why I chose this career path: to learn
                        tools and acquire knowledge that would give me the 
                        capacity to work on projects that would
                        benefit society.
                        It was a pleasure to be involved in this great event.</p>
