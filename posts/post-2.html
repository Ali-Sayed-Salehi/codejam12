                    <h3>KDF Group</h3>
                    <p>Heyo this is KDF! We are a rag-tag group of CompSci and 
                        engineering students from McGill and Polytech, and we 
                        are really excited to be here this weekend!
                    </p>
                    <p>But alas, such is the life of 
                        the Pure JS Lovers at CodeJam 12. To make a long story 
                        short: It's been a wild and fun ride for our team so 
                        far at CodeJam. We've learned a lot, and we hope the 
                        rest of our competitors have had as much fun as we have. 
                        I think it's safe to say we've sacrificed an offensive 
                        amount of code readability and organized software design 
                        for the sake of functionality (Prof. Martin Robillard 
                        would no doubt be extremely disappointed with us on this 
                        front)â€¦ Maybe you can relate.</p> 
                        
                        <p>In any case, the grind has 
                        been lots of fun and sometimes this is just how the 
                        cookie crumbles when you're on a time-crunch. We're 
                        excited to see everyone else's projects and wish 
                        everyone the best of luck. And nice work on putting 
                        together this blog!"
